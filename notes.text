## **ABOUT US → OUR STORY**

### The Legacy Behind Dallas Wallcare: A Story of Grit and Growth

Long before Coimbatore—one of India's foremost industrial hubs—emerged as a center for construction-oriented manufacturing, the roots of Dallas Wallcare were quietly taking shape. The story traces back to the late 1960s and 1970s in Mettupalayam, a historically rich town near Coimbatore.

It was here that a determined individual, with no formal education or support system, began his journey by trading vegetables in the local market. This remarkable man made the bold transition from agriculture to bulk trading, gradually earning a reputation for integrity, courage, and unwavering hard work.

Fueled by deep faith, sincerity, and a tireless spirit, he overcame every challenge—despite lacking financial resources, academic credentials, or powerful connections. He stood strong, like a rock amidst a raging sea.

What started as a modest trading venture eventually became the foundation of KKM—an identity forged through resilience, principles, and perseverance. Today, that legacy has grown into a cutting-edge research and development center, driving innovation in the construction materials industry.

The same indomitable spirit that empowered K.K. Mathan, the Legend, now propels the growth of Dallas Wallcare, inspiring advancements in manufacturing and modern construction technologies.
